#### Have you ever thought you are above the average?
#### Or if you have been frustrated because people are not noticing your hard work?
#### Or even you fell part of a huge conspiracy around you, where people/conditions won’t allow you shire and reach the excellence, no netter what you do?

If you answered yes, and truly believe in those assumptions; you are average... 
In reality, you are not special enough to make people conspire against you or even boycott your work. 

In the moment you accept and embrace those thoughts. You can change your mindset and allow your self to progress and retrieve success easy as saying. 

That easy? Actually no. 
On a side note. Do not misunderstand with self-demotion and self-evaluation badly. It’s quite the opposite I will explain with math ( don’t be afraid);

If you answered yes to one of those questions above. It’s safe to assume you, reader, feels somehow special. Or even if you didn’t answer a thing. Might somehow feel special. If you think and feel and at some point are sure of it. I gladly invite you to prove it. The idea to accept you are indispensable are fairly more attractive than the opposite. 
As a software engineer, I will prove to my self I’m not. 
Let’s start with our points spaces. We can start by city level... but I’m more interested in a more realistic and global solution. Let’s start with the entire country... The Netherlands ask your self, how many engineers like myself graduates with that title? Let’s say 10,000 per year, however, the Netherlands keeps importing this kind of engineers from all around the world, let’s now think globally, how many? Let’s say 2M per year with the same title as me... but still not a fair look at the entire population, why? Because not necessarily someone undergraduate in software engineering will work on the field and be sure you will find amazing software engineers they never put the foot on the university or any formal educational institution. Where now? Let’s accept that at least once in life they needed help from any platform, the most popular is the StackOverflow what they say? Well, in the entire world we have at least 300M active software engineers working and trying their best to actively achieve excellence. 

Ok. “You just told me to not self-demote, you somehow are not on the bottom of that sea of people” you might think. Yes, we are not. However the next steps we need to take it very carefully. 

Now think, everything that makes you special (business speaking). Let’s filter the people with equal or better knowledge than you, how do you know it? Be super honest if they can prove a simple only profile, ppt, references, certificates or/and third-party projects well those people are one step ahead of you. If you can’t prove your knowledge and passions apart a good screening and interview it will be harder to prove you should be on top of the stack. 

After that fictional stack of people, always look up to be inspired and get mentors and role models, to make a better job. If you don’t have those people it’s important to have them. 
Look down and always be open to listen to people and most important help people to move up, sometimes you will find better and younger people that inevitably will overcome yourself easy and pie, luckily you will not be remembered as that guy cheering for misfortune of others, don’t be that person;
I understand that pride is a huge rock on the road but it’s also possible to be role models for those people.  The whole idea of evolution is that new generation will have better chances to adapt to the new environments. It's nature. It’s stats. Nothing will change just because you want or said so. Remember you are not special. 

For me with all my efforts to be more visible on stack-overflow, having a better resume and better visibility projects on GitHub, and all my certificates on online courses and universities diplomas. I can count at least 35,000 people better than me right now... 

Having this kind of mindset it’s necessary to understand: you are not special and you have better work to do and have to overcome yourself multiples times, stop whining. 

Once you acknowledge those facts you will receive and give better feedback. You will understand your skews and where to impress better people and ultimately understand your true value.
