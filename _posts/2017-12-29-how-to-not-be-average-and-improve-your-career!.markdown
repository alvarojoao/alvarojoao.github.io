 - Do you think you are *always* above the average?
 - Are you frustrated because people are not noticing your hard work?
 - Have you ever felt part of a huge conspiracy around you, where people/conditions won’t allow you shire and reach the excellence, no matter what you do?
 
If you answered **YES**, and truly believe in those assumptions; you are **below** average... 

   In fact, you are **not special** enough to make people **conspire against you** or even **boycott your work**.  As seen on *The power of habit by Charles Duhigg*, the mind always build *patterns* that **easiest explain the facts around you**, it's hard to have a better self-evaluation when it's hard to accept that you are part of the problem.
   
   The idea to accept you are indispensable are fairly more attractive than the opposite. I gladly invite you to prove your indispensability.
   
   As a **software engineer**, I will prove to myself I’m **not special** with the following *3 steps*:<br/> 

*Disclaimer: Do not misunderstand with pessimism and self-depreciation. It’s quite the opposite I will explain with math! ( don’t be afraid);*

### 1 - Understanding my sample space:

Let’s start with our sample space. 

  We can start at city level... but I’m more interested in a bigger and **realistic solution**, for this purpose we will use StackOverflow database (https://data.stackexchange.com). 
  
  I ask myself, how many engineers like myself is available in the market with **Software engineer title**?
  
   - Let’s start with the entire country (where I’m currently living): *Netherlands*.  It's safe to say around **20,406**. However, the *Netherlands* keeps importing that kind of engineers from all around the world, our market it's not local. We need to think globally;<br/>
   - Globally our number jumps to **8,2M** with the same title as me... but still not a fair enough this number is not correct; why? Because our heuristic is not correct our solution does not give the real number. Not necessarily all developers have an account on StackOverflow, in software engineering market;<br/>
   - Realistically, it's safe to assume all kind of backgrounds around the software engineers, as the ones with and without a formal university/college education, hobbyists, and freelancers. How big now? around **18,2 M** (https://www.quora.com/Approximately-how-many-programmers-are-there-in-the-world);<br/>
  
### 2 - My placement (self-evaluation):

   Ok wait... You just said: "not self-depreciation" <br/>
                             "I'm not in the bottom of that sea of people"- You may think; <br/>
   Yes, we are not!<br/>
   However, the next steps we need to take it very carefully, how to self-evaluate?<br>
   Just let strong shreds of evidence do the hard lift for you;<br/>
   
Now let's gather the following:

   - profiles, your profile on any platform (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Blogs,...) is, in most cases, the channel where you are making your first impressions;<br/>
   - presentations or articles, made by you preferably with business impacts and results from the previous company/jobs;<br/>
   - references and recommendations, like LinkedIn's; <br/>
   - certificates;<br/>
   - diplomas or Academic titles;<br/>
  
  If you can’t prove your knowledge and passions during a good screening and interview, it will be harder to prove you should be on top of the stack. <br/>
  
  To understand that thought, think yourself as the recruiter that needs to decide a good person for the position, we have Option A and Option B, no matter what you think about the options, you need to choose the candidate that best prove its value and fits your needs by providing pieces of evidence;

### 3 - My true value:

If you have done right, you will be a complex average of more experience or more talented people and others growing and willing to reach your place.

After placing yourself on that fictional stack of people; I'm sure you won't be on top of it (if you are congrats, that means you are unique, really? I don't think so). Always look up to be inspired and get mentors and role models, to make a better job. If you don’t have those people it’s important to have them. 

  Look down and always be open to listen to people and most important help them to move up *"When you help others, you can't helping help yourself"*, sometimes you will find better and younger people that inevitably will overcome yourself, luckily you will not be remembered as that guy cheering for misfortune of others, **don’t be that person**;

### Conclusion:

   I understand that pride is a *huge* rock on the road but by removing it you will be easier to detect your weaknesses and improving points. By improving *1%* every day, you will evolve to a better and better version of yourself increasing your chances to adapt to new environments. It's natural. Nothing will change just because you want or said so. Remember you are not special. 

   Once you acknowledge those facts you will receive and give better feedback, impress more people and ultimately understand your true value. *At the moment you accept and embrace the thoughts of not being special, you will be more likely to change and get more concretes results.*
  
- Is that easy? Actually no. 

#### So, Let me know in which of the three above you have accomplished or where you are getting struggle.

Best regards,
